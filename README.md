###Map


I combined two data sets in Carto to create my map. Data from the rural areas around the world and daily storms. My intention was to see which areas are the most affected and if those include rural areas or not.

Additionally, I wanted to change the position of the legend, but I think this is not possible on Carto.

I had some problems to access the code and I could embed on gist.
However, here is the link [Daily storms in Rural Areas Around the World](https://andrecr.carto.com/builder/b6e8508a-9544-11e6-baf7-0e3ebc282e83/embed?state=%7B%22map%22%3A%7B%22center%22%3A%5B24.5271348225978%2C-397.44140624999994%5D%2C%22zoom%22%3A2%7D%7D)to my map and some pictures.
